# ðŸ§® DSA - Data Structures and Algorithms

This repository contains my implementations and practice problems related to Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA), written in Python/C++/Java (mention whichever language you use).

It serves as a collection of solved problems from platforms like LeetCode, Codeforces, GeeksforGeeks, and others. Perfect for interview preparation, competitive programming, and strengthening problem-solving skills.
